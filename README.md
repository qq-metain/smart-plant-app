Flutter smart plant care app
Smart Plant Care is a mobile application based on Flutter that helps users manage plant care more scientifically through a 'record + cloud synchronization + reminder' approach. Users can create profiles for each plant, take photos to mark attendance, record watering and fertilizing, and view trends on the history and statistics pages. In the future, it can be expanded with a Bluetooth (BLE) soil moisture sensor to achieve a more complete Connected Environment experience.
# Project Background and Problem (Problem) 
Many novice plant keepers often encounter these problems:
- They are unsure when to water, and tend to overwater or underwater.
- They do not keep records of their care activities, making it difficult to trace the causes (such as why leaves suddenly turn yellow or fall off).
- Changes in plants are gradual and hard to notice with the naked eye, requiring photo or data comparisons.
- Different plants have different needs, but it is difficult for users to establish a personalized care routine.
# Project Goal
This project aims to transform 'plant maintenance' into a process that is trackable, reminder-driven, and reviewable: 
- Record the changes through photos and logs.
- Store the data in the cloud for easy cross-device synchronization and long-term accumulation.
- Use statistics and reminders to make it easier for users to establish patterns
